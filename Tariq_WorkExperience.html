                        <br> Welcome to my work experience page! Feel free to review over my resume, linked above, and also check out the various experiences I've had while in high school.        
                        <br>
                        <br>Throughout the Principles or Engineering course, we had many guest speakers who had interesting stories and backgrounds. One that stood out to me was Maynard Holliday, who works in the RAND corporation. The RAND corporation provides intelect to the Armed Forces of the United States. What was important about Mr. Holliday’s career to me was how diverse it was. Hearing about Mr. Holliday’s career showed me how diverse the field of engineering is. Prior to working in the Rand corporation, Mr. Holliday worked as an advisor for President Obama. I realized that there are many opportunities in the Engineering field.
                        <br>
                        <br>During the coronavirus pandemic, when we were quarantined, we had a guest speaker named  Cesar Nicola who resides in South America but has various teams in other countries. What I learned from this guest speaker was how to manage my time to make the best out of every day and also how to communicate with others to achieve the best product in a team setting. As mentioned, Mr. Nicola’s team was in various countries. So it was important that his team communicate and set meetings at times which work for everyone due to the time differences. Mr. Nicola also worked remotely, and from that I learned how important it is to stay organized and keep a strict schedule to complete all the work one must do in a day. 
                        <br>
                        <br>The first field trip I took back in my sophomore year was to the Simpson Strong-tie headquarters in Pleasenton, CA. This trip was very interesting to me beacuse it was my first time experinecing what a real office enviorment looks like in the field of engineering. I also had the oppertunity to meet many employees, and ask questions which would help me in the future. 
                        <br>
                        <br>The second field trip I took was to the Workday headquarters in Pleasenton, CA. Whereas Simpson Strong-tie is a manufacturing and materials company, Workday's office space looks similar to what one would expect from a bay area tech company. Touring the campus was very interesting, and gave me a new goal to work towards. 
                        <br>
                        <br>I took a virtual field trip to Lockheed Martin, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, during my senior year of high school. Lockheed Martin is an aerospace company, and through this experience I was able to talk with individuals who design aircrafts and also students in their intership program. I'm glad I was able to get information on their intership program, which is something I am looking forward to applying for in college. 
                        <br>
                        <br>During the pandemic, I also did an Oracle job shadow. This was my favorite experience in the academy because I was given the oppertunity to have a one on one conversation with many different Oracle employees, and not only learn more about the company, but also get tips on what to do during college in order to be successful. 
                        <br>
                        <br>The next field trip I took was to the San Ramon Wastewater Treatment facility. This was a very interesting vitual trip in which I learned about the mechanics of how wastewater is trasnported, and the infastructure the facility has in place. The virtual tour was also very interesting as we met several employees along the way. 
                        <br>
                        <br>The last field trip I took in the academy was the Livermore Aviation tour of the private airfield in Livermore, CA. This was one of my favorite experiences as I have always wanted to learn how private airfields operate, and how they are different from commercial aiports. Through this trip I also learned about how airplanes and control towers communicate, and also learned the basics of piloting an aircraft.
                        <br>
                        <br>My mentor for the Engineering Academy is Alex Lo. Alex works in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. I learned many important lessons from Alex, especially from his years of experience in the workforce. One of the key lessons I learned from Alex is to learn to always stand out in a crowd and develop a diverse skillset which is different from other individuals who are in the same field as you.
