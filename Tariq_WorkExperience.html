                        <br>Throughout the Principles or Engineering course, we had many guest speakers who had interesting stories and backgrounds. One that stood out to me was Maynard Holliday, who works in the RAND corporation. The RAND corporation provides intelect to the Armed Forces of the United States. What was important about Mr. Holliday’s career to me was how diverse it was. Hearing about Mr. Holliday’s career showed me how diverse the field of engineering is. Prior to working in the Rand corporation, Mr. Holliday worked as an advisor for President Obama. I realized that there are many opportunities in the Engineering field.

                        <br>During the coronavirus pandemic, when we were quarantined, we had a guest speaker named  Cesar Nicola who resides in South America but has various teams in other countries. What I learned from this guest speaker was how to manage my time to make the best out of every day and also how to communicate with others to achieve the best product in a team setting. As mentioned, Mr. Nicola’s team was in various countries. So it was important that his team communicate and set meetings at times which work for everyone due to the time differences. Mr. Nicola also worked remotely, and from that I learned how important it is to stay organized and keep a strict schedule to complete all the work one must do in a day.

                        <br>My mentor for the Engineering Academy is Alex Lo. Alex works in the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California. I learned many important lessons from Alex, especially from his years of experience in the workforce. One of the key lessons I learned from Alex is to learn to always stand out in a crowd and develop a diverse skillset which is different from other individuals who are in the same field as you.
