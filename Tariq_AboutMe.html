                    <p>My name is Muhammad Tariq and I am a freshman at Dublin High School. I enjoy coding, and hope to make it a career someday. My aim for the future is to graduate from U.C. Berkeley with a bachelors in Computer Science or Software Engineering. After graduation, my goal is to dive straight into the tech field. The field of technology interests me because one can create something that is new and unique and can benefit the world.
                        <br>
                        <br> Before moving to the bay area, I lived in Irvine. My family and I moved to the bay area about 2 years ago. We moved to Foster City, where I lived for about 11 months before moving again to Dublin. A skill I acquired from moving this constantly was adaptation. I was able to adapt pretty easily to my new surroundings and environment. This is a skill that will help me in my future career because I will be able to adapt to new surroundings and people. Another helpful skill I now posses is leadership. Whenever we are assigned a group project, I tend to take the lead role in organizing and breaking up the task at hand. This skill will be useful for me when managing a team in a future job and beyond.
                        <br>
                        <br> Some other skills that will help my success in the future are time-management and working with others. When finals were coming around in 8th grade, I decided to start studying the weekend before as finals started Wednesday. Since I had finals in 3 subjects, it was imperative to my grade that I manage my time out. When I manage my time, I make sure to give me more than enough time to get my assignment done and time for other tasks as well. Other than time management, working with others is a skill that I possess that is beneficial in many scenarios. When I am the leader of the group/ team, I like to involve everyone so that the work is evenly divided up.
                        <br>
                        <br> I have learned many skills through my experiences. Working with others and adapting to surroundings are just a few examples. I hope that the skills I already possess and the skills I will acquire help me in my future. Thank you for visiting my website, and feel free to browse the rest of it.
