                    <p>My name is Muhammad Tariq and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School. I enjoy coding, and hope to utilize my coding skills in a career in the future. My goal for after high school is to graduate from U.C. Berkeley with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science or software engineering. After graduation from college, I aspire to dive into the tech field. The field of technology interests me because one can create something that is new and unique and can benefit the greater good of the world. 
                        <br>
                        <br>Before moving to the bay area, I lived in Irvine. My family and I moved to the bay area about 3 years ago. We moved to Foster City, where I lived for about 11 months before moving again to Dublin. A skill I acquired from moving this constantly was adaptation. Based on constantly moving throughout middle school, I learned to adapt to my new surroundings and atmosphere and be able to make the best out of it. This is a skill that will help me in my future career because I will be able to adapt to new surroundings and people. Another helpful skill I now possess is leadership. Whenever we are assigned a group project, I tend to take the lead role in organizing and breaking up the task at hand. This skill will be useful for me when managing a team in a future job. 
                        <br>
                        <br>Throughout my first year and a half of high school I availed various opportunities to demonstrate my distinct skill set. Despite taking many rigorous A.P and honors classes this year, I committed to participating in JV football. Both my 2 older brothers played football all 4 years of high school, so it was up to me to continue the legacy. I believe this to be one of my greatest accomplishments of this year as it was extremely difficult to manage school and football, especially when my day officially ended at 7pm when I got home from practice. After getting home, I had to manage homework, find time to eat dinner, and get enough sleep. Through this experience, I learned how to problem solve, not give up on a task so easily and time management.
                        <br>
                        <br>I have learned many skills through my experiences. Working with others and adapting to surroundings are a few examples. I hope that the skills I already possess and the skills I will acquire help me in my future. Thank you for visiting my website, feel free to navigate to the rest of the sections.
