     <h3> <strong>Scratch Game Pong -2017</strong></h3> <br> <p>Created by Muhammad Tariq and Jason Tran<br> <br> Pong is a game that my partner and I created in CSE that is meant to entertain user for hours on end. It uses many different variables to makes sure the audience is introduced to new levels after every rotation. The game was based on another game called “Ping pong game ”. I remixed it and changed many aesthetic features, along with adding new features that make for a better game.<br><br>
	
	Some features that we added were, a timer, score, and level progression. The timer starts at 120 seconds, and if there is not winner after said time, the level progresses by 1. The first player who reaches 10 points wins the game, and a new backdrop is displayed. The way the levels progress is that the ball gets progressively faster for every level up. <br>
	<br> Although I have been using scratch for many years, this project taught me many new features I didn’t know how to use. One feature I didn’t use was timer. Using a timer was very helpful in adding depth to the game in terms of difficulty. Using our resources, me and my partner were able to make a functional timer that restarted as levels progressed

     <h3> <strong>Hangman -2018</strong></h3> <br> <p>Hangman was a game my partner and I created using the coding language python on Cloud 9. The game uses a function to randomize words from a word bank and another to take input, a letter, from the player to check if the guessed letter is in the secret word.  We picked a marvel based theme for this game as there are countless words we could use based on marvel. 

<br> <br> My partner and I added many features to optimize this game experience. A player has a maximum of 5 tries to guess the word before the “secret” word is presented to them. If one gets a letter right, that letter is displayed on the game board for everywhere it is in the secret word. If the players guess is more than a letter than a message is displayed that reads, "Please enter only one letter." If the player enters a number instead of a letter, a message that reads, "Please enter a letter, not a number.", is presented.

<br> <br>Before taking CSE I didn’t have any experience with python. When I first started to learn it, it was confusing to me as I was having a hard time differentiating the functions and methods. Through this project, my understanding for python grew exponentially. By asking my partner some questions and using resources like the internet, I was able to also learn new material not taught in class.

     <h3> <strong>Mechanical Winch System -2018</strong></h3> <br> <p>During the first semester of Principles of Engineering, my group and I were assigned to create a winch system that could lift heavy objects various heights. My group and I had to build a scaled model of the winch system that could lift more than 100 grams at least 30 centimeters on the edge of a table as well as a simulation of the model on netlogo. This was my favorite project in POE as it combined physical engineering with the construction of the model as well, and computer science with the simulation. One constraint we had for this project was to figure out a configuration of the model in which the winch is able to suspend the 100 grams without the rod bending or the whole assembly topping over. In order to solve this problem we added weight to the opposite side of the winch to balance it out. Some skills I learned in this project include time management and dividing up work evenly among partners. Since we were only given about a week and a half for this project, it was imperative to be on task and complete all assigned work. Due to the workload, making sure every team member had a job to do was also crucial.
