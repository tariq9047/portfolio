     <h3> <strong>Scratch game Pong -2017</strong></h3> <br> <p>Created by Muhammad Tariq and Jason Tran<br> <br> Pong is a game that my partner and I created in CSE that is meant to entertain user for hours on end. It uses many different variables to makes sure the audience is introduced to new levels after every rotation. The game was based on another game called “Ping pong game ”. I remixed it and changed many aesthetic features, along with adding new features that make for a better game.<br><br>
	
	Some features that we added were, a timer, score, and level progression. The timer starts at 120 seconds, and if there is not winner after said time, the level progresses by 1. The first player who reaches 10 points wins the game, and a new backdrop is displayed. The way the levels progress is that the ball gets progressively faster for every level up. <br>
	<br> Although I have been using scratch for many years, this project taught me many new features I didn’t know how to use. One feature I didn’t use was timer. Using a timer was very helpful in adding depth to the game in terms of difficulty. Using our resources, me and my partner were able to make a functional timer that restarted as levels progressed
